# wt - Git Worktree CLI Helper

A simple and intuitive command-line tool for managing Git worktrees, making it easier to work on multiple features or tasks simultaneously without switching branches in your main repository.

## Description

`wt` (worktree) is a Bash script that simplifies Git worktree management by providing easy-to-use commands for creating, navigating, and cleaning up worktrees. It follows a consistent naming convention and helps maintain a clean workspace.

## Features

- üöÄ Create worktrees with a single command
- üìÅ Easy navigation between worktrees
- üìã List all active worktrees
- üß© Merge and cleanup finished work
- üßπ Delete worktrees without merging
- üåø Consistent branch naming (`tmp/<task-name>`)
- üìç Predictable worktree locations (`../<project>-<task-name>`)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Git (already installed on most systems)
- Bash shell
- Linux/macOS/WSL environment

### Quick Installation

#### Option 1: One-line installer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rickieplin/wt-cli.git ~/tools/wt-cli && cd ~/tools/wt-cli && ./install.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rickieplin/wt-cli.git ~/tools/wt-cli
   ```

2. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   cd ~/tools/wt-cli
   ./install.sh
   ```

#### Option 3: Manual steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rickieplin/wt-cli.git ~/tools/wt-cli
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/tools/wt-cli/wt
   ```

3. Create a symlink in your PATH:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/bin
   ln -s ~/tools/wt-cli/wt ~/bin/wt
   ```

4. Add `~/bin` to your PATH (if not already there):
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   wt -h
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Start a new task
```bash
# Create a new worktree for a feature
wt start feature-login

# This creates:
# - Worktree at: ../myproject-feature-login/
# - Branch: tmp/feature-login (based on main)
```

### Navigate to a worktree
```bash
# Open a subshell in the worktree directory
wt cd feature-login
```

### List all worktrees
```bash
wt list
```

### Finish a task (merge and cleanup)
```bash
# Merges tmp/feature-login into main, then removes worktree and branch
wt finish feature-login
```

### Delete without merging
```bash
# Remove worktree and branch without merging
wt delete feature-login
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `wt start <task-name>` | Create a new worktree with branch `tmp/<task-name>` based on `main` |
| `wt cd <task-name>` | Change directory to the worktree (opens a subshell) |
| `wt list` | List all current worktrees |
| `wt finish <task-name>` | Merge branch into `main`, remove worktree and delete branch |
| `wt delete <task-name>` | Remove worktree and delete branch without merging |
| `wt -h`, `wt --help`, `wt help` | Display help message |

## Workflow Example

```bash
# Start working on a new feature
wt start user-authentication

# Navigate to the worktree
wt cd user-authentication

# Work on your feature...
# (make changes, commits, etc.)

# When done, exit the subshell
exit

# Merge your work back to main
wt finish user-authentication
```

## Configuration

The tool uses the following conventions:

- **Base branch**: `main` (all worktrees branch from here)
- **Branch naming**: `tmp/<task-name>`
- **Worktree location**: `../<project-name>-<task-name>/`

## Troubleshooting

### "Not in a Git repository" error
Make sure you run `wt` commands from within a Git repository.

### "Branch already exists" error
A branch with that name already exists. Either finish/delete the existing task or choose a different name.

### "Worktree not found" error
The worktree doesn't exist. Use `wt list` to see available worktrees.
